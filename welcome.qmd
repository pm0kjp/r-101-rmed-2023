## R 101: Intro to R for Clinical Data {.section-break background-image="media/cork-board.png" background-size="400px" background-repeat="repeat"}


::: notes
\[Start at 0:02 past starting time.\]

Hello and welcome to R 101. We're glad you're here!

## Introducing your Presenters and TAs! {.smaller}

Presenters: Joy Payton and Stephan Kadauke, MD, PhD

Teaching Assistants:

-   Rose Hartman
-
-

::: notes


We have several great Teaching Assistants, as well, including the folks whose names you see here. They will be helping learners out one on one, so if you're struggling, please reach out in chat and one of the TAs will help!

The main part of the workshop will be webinar style, with everyone in one big session, and participants will be muted and cameras off. We are recording the main session for replay.

We will have one or two breakout sessions. For the breakouts, we encourage you to participate by turning on your microphone. We also encourage you to turn on your camera, if you are comfortable, but that's completely up to you. We won't record breakout sessions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](media/main_zoom_window.png){.bordered fig-align="center"}

Familiarize yourself with:

-   Participants
-   Chat

::: notes
This is the main Zoom window. On the bottom you should be able to see two buttons - Participants and Chat.

Click on these buttons now to open the Participants and Chat windows, and place those windows somewhere you can see, if necessary by making your main Zoom window a little smaller.
:::

## Non-Verbal Feedback

The "Yes, go ahead" feedback with the check mark is important today!

![](media/feedback.png){.half .centered fig-align="center"}

::: notes
We will make heavy use of the Non-verbal Feedback functionality of Zoom. At various points, we presenters will ask you to click "Yes" to let us know we can keep going. What I mean by that is to click the green circle with the check mark in the Participants window. Go ahead and find that "Reactions" section of your Zoom screen now. We'll ask you to use it in just a few moments.

## Chat Window

Chat is the way we ask for help here.
:::
:::

::: notes
The primary purpose of the Chat window, for this course, is to ask for help if you get stuck with a technical issue. If you don't have a problem that someone is helping you with, you do not need to monitor the chat window to follow the course. I will also occasionally ask you to write the answer to a question in the chat.

Please note that when I'm presenting, I can't also monitor the chat at the same time, so please don't send me private messages. Instead, post to Everyone, briefly describing the problem you have, and you will get help by one of our TAs.

I also want to set expectations for help here. If you have a technical problem please use the chat to get help. But if you have questions about the material, or how to solve a problem you have that's related to what we're talking about at the moment, I encourage you to write it down, and ask during the breaks, or after the workshop.

## Your Turn #1 {background-color="#e3faf1"}

Click the "yes" button (green check) in the Participants window. Then tell us your location (city, country) in the Chat window.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 1, seconds = 00)
```

::: notes
This brings us to the first interactive exercise! In the "Reactions" section of Zoom, please click on the "yes" button (the green button with a check mark). When you do this, it tells us as presenters that you're there, you're listening, and you're ready to continue.

Also, please tell us who you are! In the chat window, please tell us where you're joining us from.

We'll give you about one minute to do this exercise.

## Orientation to the Course {.section-break background-image="media/cork-board.png" background-size="400px" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: notes
Great, now that we have technology squared away, let's move ahead and learn about the scope of today's learning.
:::

## The Data Analysis Pipeline

![](media/data_analysis_pipeline.png){.centered}

::: notes
This workshop is a gentle introduction to data science designed for healthcare professionals and researchers who don't have a background in programming. This slide shows a high-level conceptual framework of the most important steps of the data analysis process.

You always start by importing data and cleaning or "tidying" it up.

Then you start an iterative process of exploratory data analysis, which usually requires some data transformation.

The main engines of knowledge generation are visualization and modeling.

Finally, you need to communicate your results.

We will introduce the basics of all of these steps today, with the exception of modeling.
:::

## Lecture Slides

![](media/slide_example.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
In general, we will introduce new concepts with lecture slides like this one. We try to illustrate the concepts in a way that makes it easier to learn how to write code. Importantly, you will have access to the slides and be able to look at them again after you leave this course.

## Timed Interactive Coding Exercises

::: notes
After we present you with explanations, we'll then practice these new skills with timed interactive coding exercises. For the coding exercises, we set up a training environment on the web specifically for this course.

Please note that these exercises are timed. It's not essential that you finish each exercise, but it's essential that you try. When the time is up, I ask that everyone stop working. After each coding exercise, we will come back together, and I will live code the exercise to catch everyone up.

<https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine/attend/code-of-conduct/>

::: notes
One more serious thing I need to point out, since this is an interactive course - we want to provide a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.

So we have a strict no-harassment policy: this includes abusive, offensive, or degrading language, in writing or in voice.

We also want people to feel that they can be themselves, especially in breakout rooms. While we will be recording this main session, we ask that participants refrain from taking screenshots or recording their fellow learners.
:::

## Your Turn #2 {background-color="#e3faf1"}

Meet and greet! We will send you into breakout rooms, where you will have 10 minutes to meet one of our TAs and some of your fellow participants.

::: notes
This brings us to our first breakout session! When the invitation appears to join a breakout room, please go ahead and join.

For this exercise, we encourage you to turn on your microphone and camera, if you're comfortable.

At the 10 min mark, we'll bring everyone back into the main session.  Depending on how many participants we have, there may be a lot of you in each break room, so we folks to be mindful of time when you introduce yourself and why you're in this session.
